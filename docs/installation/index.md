# Installation

In order to successfully install LabGym, you will need to install Python 3.9 or 3.10 and add Python to 'PATH'.

If you are on a Windows or Linux system with an NVIDIA GPU, you will need the following installed to enable GPU-accelerated processing:

 - CUDA Toolkit 11.8
 - cuDNN

We recommend that you follow the instructions below for your operating system to ensure that the installation goes smoothly. However, if your system configuration requires that you install these dependencies in a different way, (e.g. you're using a computing cluster that uses Lmod to load Python) feel free to go ahead and do that.

The simplest way to install LabGym is using `pip`. You may also use `pipx` or `Anaconda` to install LabGym in an isolated environment. For more information, please see the system-specific instructions below.
